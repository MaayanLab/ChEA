# ChIP-X Enrichment Analysis 

Database contains manually extracted datasets of transcription-factor/target-gene interactions from over 100 experiments such as ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq, ChIP-PET applied to mammalian cells. We use the database to analyze mRNA expression data where we perform gene-list enrichment analysis as the prior biological knowledge gene-list library. The system is delivered as web-based interactive software. With this software users can input lists of mammalian genes for which the program computes over-representation of transcription factor targets from the ChEA database.
